VTags is a tags file generator, written entirely in Vim.

It currently supports only the PHP and Vim languages, but adding a new
language should be trivial. 

The speed is not one of the best around yet, but I'm working on this.

This one being the first release, it's quite in alpha stage. The
language definitions are experimental, to verify that the parsing engine
works. The parser only works on full lines, so if a line contains more,
say, function definitions, only the first one will be taken. I will be
working on supporting multiple definitions in one line, but _after_
I get the speed fixed :)
It's the first unstable slow alpha testing thing. Be kind with me ;)

Any feedback would be very much appreciated.

Requires: vimscript #338 (vtags_def)
